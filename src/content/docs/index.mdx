## About Us

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Golf Drill Challenge" icon="error">
    The OSU Men's Golf Team faces a problem in providing structured and personalized golf training for its players. Monitoring individual progress, and having healthy competition among team members require an efficient solution. 
    
    Currently, players cannot use their phones to follow drills assigned by their coach, restricting their ability to practice asynchronously outside of regular team sessions. Subsequently, the coaching staff cannot digitally individualize and assign the drills to the players in accordance with personal skill sets. 
    
    Moreover, there is no dedicated centralized platform for both the players and coaches to track, store, and share golf drill performance data, which limits the team's players from identifying weaknesses and improving their golf skills effectively. Finally, there is a need to encourage a healthy competition within the OSU Golf team, by having leaderboards for each drill the coach creates, thereby encouraging players to do their best to succeed in completing the drills.

    * **Team Management:** Coaches can promote people to assistant coaches and remove players from the team if they graduate.
    * **Drill Distribution:** Coach is able to distribute drills to the players individually for improving specific skills or to the whole team for practices.
    * **Drill Scoring:** Players can score themselves on a drill and see results from completing drills including strokes gained for certain drill types.
    * **Leaderboards:** After scoring a drill, player's best attempts will be kept on the leaderboard for every player to compare to for friendly competition.
    * **Performance Charts:** Players are able to view their stats over time on each drill to see where they are improving and where they still need improvement on.
